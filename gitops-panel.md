Git is the source of truth
Operation by PR

GitOps is if all the workflow to make changes to your production system in Git

"It's developer workflows for operations"
Git is audited

Pay attention to the human side of it, people need to understand what they need to do, why and how.
People are hard

Git is a collaborative tool, 
GitOps as a way to prevent heroism, its all audited there and everyone has to use the same config.

Your system should be unstable as long as you have the needs to stabilise.

"If this push to prod goes wrong, its fine, no one will get in trouble, with gitops we can fix it"

Time to recover is the most important, broken change can be trivially reverted

Do more and more testing in production

Take observability more seriously

Main thing with gitops, is people and processes, look at your groups and how you are going to help them
